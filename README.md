## Overview

The Heurist Agent Framework is built on a modular architecture that allows an AI agent to:
- Process text and voice messages
- Generate images and videos
- Interact across multiple platforms with consistent behavior
- Fetch and store information in a knowledge base (Postgres and SQLite supported)
- Access external APIs, tools, and a wide range of [Mesh Agents](./mesh/README.md) to compose complex workflows

## Heurist Mesh
![mesh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77a2ab3b-e35c-4313-8a5b-a0e751cac879)

**Heurist Mesh** is an open network where AI agents are contributed by the community and used modularly—similar to DeFi smart contracts. Each agent is a specialized unit that can process data, generate reports, or perform actions while collectively forming an intelligent swarm to tackle complex tasks. Each agent is accessible via a unified REST API interface, and can be used in conjunction with any agent framework or application.

Want to contribute your own agent? Check out the [Mesh README](./mesh/README.md) for detailed guidelines, examples, and best practices.

### MCP Support
**Just In:** All Heurist Mesh agents are accessible via MCP! This means you can access them from your favorite MCP client, including [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf).

Head to [heurist-mesh-mcp-server](https://github.com/heurist-network/heurist-mesh-mcp-server) to set up a server and give your AI assistant a powerup.

## Heurist Agent Framework Architecture

The framework follows a modular, component-based architecture:

<div align="center">
<img src="./docs/img/agent_hl.png" alt="Heurist Agent Framework" width="500">
</div>

### Agent Structure

1. **BaseAgent** (Abstract Base Class)
   - Defines the interface and common functionality
   - Manages component initialization and lifecycle
   - Implements core messaging patterns

2. **CoreAgent** (Concrete Implementation)
   - Implements BaseAgent functionality
   - Orchestrates components and workflows
   - Handles decision-making for workflow selection

### Agent Interfaces

Each interface inherits from BaseAgent and implements platform-specific handling:

- **Telegram** (`interfaces/telegram_agent.py`)
- **Discord** (`interfaces/discord_agent.py`)
- **API** (`interfaces/flask_agent.py`)
- **Twitter** (`interfaces/twitter_agent.py`)
- **Farcaster** (`interfaces/farcaster_agent.py`)

### Heurist Core

Heurist Core provides a set of core components, tools, and workflows for building LLM-powered agents or agentic applications. It can be used as a standalone package or as part of the Heurist Agent Framework.

[Read the Heurist Core documentation](./core/README.md)

#### Components

The framework uses a modular component system:

- **PersonalityProvider**: Manages agent personality and system prompts
- **KnowledgeProvider**: Handles knowledge retrieval from vector database
- **ConversationManager**: Manages conversation history and context
- **ValidationManager**: Validates inputs and outputs
- **MediaHandler**: Processes images, audio, and other media
- **LLMProvider**: Interfaces with language models
- **MessageStore**: Stores and retrieves messages with vector search

#### Workflows

Workflows provide higher-level reasoning patterns:

- **AugmentedLLMCall**: Standard RAG + tools pattern for context-aware responses
- **ChainOfThoughtReasoning**: Multi-step reasoning with planning and execution phases
- **ResearchWorkflow**: Deep web search and analysis with hierarchical exploration

#### Tool Management

- **ToolBox**: Base framework for tool definition and registration
- **Tools**: Tool management and execution layer
- **ToolsMCP**: Integration with Machine Cognition Protocol

#### External Clients

- **SearchClient**: Unified client for web search (Firecrawl/Exa)
- **MCPClient**: Client for Machine Cognition Protocol
